    <h1>Culture</h1>
    <p>The Deaf community in the United States forms a vibrant cultural and linguistic minority for whom ASL is not only a mode of communication, but a central part of identity. According to the article on ASL, this language is deeply tied to the experiences and social life of its users — children of Deaf adults (CODAs), Deaf / Hard-of-Hearing individuals and others who embrace ASL often regard themselves as members of a distinct cultural community rather than simply as people with a disability. 
    In this culture, ASL is prioritised over systems that map directly to spoken English, and practices such as visual attention, eye contact, and spatial awareness are fundamental norms. 
    Historically, Deaf culture has grown out of both educational settings (such as early Deaf schools) and communal gatherings, where ASL use and social networks flourished despite efforts for assimilation via “oralismToday, Deaf cultural spaces celebrate storytelling, artistic expression, social connection and shared values of dedication to language and community. By understanding this culture as more than just communication, but as a rich, lived experience rooted in ASL and its community, we gain appreciation for the unique heritage and ongoing vitality of Deaf life in North America</p>
