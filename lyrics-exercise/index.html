            <p class="italic-text">[Verse 1]</p>
            <p>Dangerous little body<br>
            Should I step or should I back down?<br>
            Fade into the background<br>
            Playin' with me, look what you started<br>
            Why you keep hesitating, need to stop it, boy, stop it<br>
            Never wanted labels, looking like you're taken now (taken now)<br></p>
<br>
             <p class="italic-text">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
            <p>Tell me, who's that girl you with?<br>
            You saw me out with another, I already did that<br>
            Baby, who's that girl you with?<br>
            You saw me out with my brothers, that was a kickback<br>
            Okay, so who's that girl you with?<br>
            I saw you out with another, you on the get back<br>
            Tell me, who's that girl you with<br></p>
<br>
             <p class="italic-text">[Chorus A]</p>
            <p>Baby, I'm done<br>
            Who have I become?<br>
            Said I was the one<br>
            Where did I go wrong?<br>
            It ain't all 'bout us<br>
            Who have I become?<br>
            Said I was the one<br>
            Where did I go wrong?<br>
            It ain't all 'bout us<br></p>
<br>
             <p class="italic-text">[Verse 2]</p>
            <p>I might sound obsessed<br>
            But your new girl's not impressive<br>
            I'm tight as my dress is<br>
            Hold on, my rich daddy's callin'<br>
            Feeling like misbehaving, might just start somethin', start somethin'<br>
            Maybe I'm instigating, can you take it now?<br></p>
<br>
             <p class="italic-text">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
            <p>Tell me, who's that girl you with?<br>
            You saw me out with another, I already did that<br>
            Baby, who's that girl you with?<br>
            You saw me out with my brothers, that was a kickback<br>
            Okay, so who's that girl you with?<br>
            I saw you out with another, you on the get back<br>
            Tell me, who's that girl you with<br></p>
<br>
             <p class="italic-text">[Outro]</p>
            <p>Baby, I'm done<br>
            Who have I become?<br>
            Said I was the one<br>
            Where did I wrong?<br>
            It ain't all 'bout us<br>
            Who have I become?<br>
            Said I was the one<br>
            Where did I wrong?<br>
            It ain't all 'bout us<br></p>
