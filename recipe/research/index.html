        <h1>Banana Bread</h1>
    </header>

    <p class="description">Banana bread is a type of quick bread made from mashed, overripe bananas mixed into a batter with flour, sugar, eggs, and fat, leavened with baking soda, and baked in a loaf pan. It's known for its moist, tender crumb, sweet banana flavor, and is often made with add-ins like nuts or chocolate chips.</p>
