        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        
        <p> <b>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</b></p>
        <p> My name is Hana Rust, I'm a BFA CDes junior.</p>

        <p> <b>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b> 
        <p> I don't have much experience coding, but I'm taking this class to fulfill my CDes major requirement. I've always wanted to learn basic coding skills so i'm excited for this course.</p>

        <p> <b>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</b> 
        <p> I used a little HTML for a Type 1 project where we created basic webpages. Besides that, I don't have any experience.</p>

        <p> <b>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</b>
        <p> I hope to become somewhat intuitive with common HTML commands to code webpages without needing to look up commands.</p>

        <p> <b>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</b>
        <p> Designing on a screen requires consideration of different kinds of devices that a viewer might be using. For example, a phone, tablet, or laptop. </p>

        <p> <b>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b>
        <p> I think that <a href="https://drinkolipop.com/?srsltid=AfmBOori0gd4LToXfcwd20fNJhF_U6hHbUq6Id38Cmwn1kCjIYbtHCp9">Ollipop</a> has effective web design. They use colors, imagery, and textures that are appealing and engaging to the viewer. They also use a clear grid without being boring. There's enough variability to make the site engaging.</p>

        <p> <b>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</b></p>
        <p> I think that the <a href="https://www.gong.io">Gong</a> website demostrates effective communication. Their website uses simple infographics and icons to convey statistics, along with clear, bold headers to convey the main message.</p>

        <p> <b>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b></p>
        <p> I think that the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/"> LinkedIn</a> website works well. They manage to organize lots of complicated information into a way that is intuitive to use.</p>
